-- THKY, if you see this, change of plans! Instead of 4 bits for instructions and 4 bits for datavalue1 I've decided that we only really need 3 bits for datavalue1. This allows us to now have about 31 instructions, and 7 registers! Much more balanced then 15 instructions and 15 registers.
local Parser = {}

function Parser.ParsePair(byte1, byte2)
	
end

return Parser
